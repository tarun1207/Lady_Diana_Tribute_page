            <p><b>1961:</b> Diana Frances Spencer, born July 1, was the fourth of five
               children born to John Spencer, the 8th Earl Spencer and his first
               wife, Frances Ruth Roche.</p>
            <p><b>1967:</b> The Spencers separate when Diana is six years old. The divorce
               would not be final until 1969, following a child custody battle won
               by her father. In later years, her younger brother, Charles, blames
               the split on the loss of their first son, John, who died within hours
               of his birth in 1960, and the difficulty of producing a male
               heir.</p>
            <p><b>1970:</b> Diana, age 9, enrolls at Riddlesworth Hall, an all-girls
               boarding school in Norfolk.</p>
            <p><b>1973:</b> Diana joins older sisters Jane and Sarah at West Heath Girls'
               School in Kent, where she shows talent in music and sports but not
               academics. Later, she fails her O-level exams twice, and leaves
               without the equivalent of a high school diploma.</p>
            <p><b>1975:</b> Diana, 13, is given the title of Lady after her grandfather dies
               and her father inherits the title Earl of Spencer and the Althorp
               estate.</p>
            <p><b>1977:</b> Diana first meets future husband Prince Charles, who at the time
               was dating her older sister Sarah.</p>
            <p><b>Feb. 24, 1981:</b> Charles and Diana go public with their engagement (and
               Diana debuts her famous sapphire-and-diamond ring). On the night she
               moves out of her London apartment, her protective officer warns her,
               "I just want you to know that this is your last night of freedom ever,
               in the rest of your life, so make the most of it."</p>
            <p><b>July 29, 1981:</b> Less than a month after her 20th birthday, Diana weds
               Charles, 32, at St. Paul's Cathedral, which better accommodated their
               2,500 guests than Westminster Abbey, the usual venue for royal weddings.
               Two more deviations from tradition: The omission of the word "obey" from
               Diana's vows (intentional) and the delay of their first kiss until
               returning to Buckingham Palace (unintentional).</p>
            <p><b>Nov. 5, 1981:</b> The palace announces Diana is pregnant with her first
               child.</p>
            <p><b>June 21, 1982:</b> The couple's first child, Prince William Arthur Philip
               Louis, is born at London's St. Mary's Hospital, where his own children
               would be born three decades later.</p>
            <p><b>March 1983:</b> Together with Charles, Diana and 9-month-old son William
               embark on their first royal tour together to Australia and New
               Zealand.</p>
            <p><b>April 1987:</b> At the peak of homophobia and fear of AIDS, Diana shakes
               hands with a man suffering from the disease without gloves at London's
               Middlesex Hospital. Her gesture is later described by journalist Judy
               Wade as "the most important thing a royal's done in 200 years" because
               it helped to dispel the misconception that the then-fatal illness could
               be transmitted by casual contact.</p>
            <p><b>March 29, 1992:</b> Diana's father, John Spencer, dies of a heart attack
               in London.</p>
            <p><b>December 1993:</b> Diana announces her plan to retire from public life,
               at least for an indefinite period, and dramatically pares down her list
               of charity patronages.</p>
            <p><b>August 1996:</b> The terms of the royal divorce are finalized. Diana is
               awarded a lump-sum settlement of $22.5 million in cash, as well as about
               $600,000 a year earmarked to maintain her private office in addition to
               receiving permission to continue living in their Kensington Palace apartment.
               She agrees to give up any future claim of being queen. </p>
            <p><b>Aug. 30, 1997:</b> A few months after her split with Khan, Diana and her new
               beau, Dodi Fayed, depart Paris' Ritz-Carlton Hotel after dinner to spend
               the night at his apartment. Their intoxicated driver, Henri Paul, later
               found to be three times over the legal limit, races through the Pont de
               l'Alma tunnel in an attempt to outrun the paparazzi. Shortly after midnight,
               he crashes their Mercedes into a cement pylon, killing himself and Fayed
               instantly. Diana and bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones are taken to the
               hospital.</p>
            <p><b>Aug. 31, 1997:</b> Diana succumbs to her injuries (mostly cardiac in nature)
               and is pronounced dead at 4 a.m. at Paris' PItié-St. Salpêtrière Hospital
               at age 36. </p>
